## Package.json
This file is the core of any Node.js project. It contains metadata about the project, including the projectâ€™s name, version, author, and a list of dependencies and scripts.

### dependencies: 
Lists the packages required for the project to run. It usually specifies version ranges (e.g., ^16.0.0, ~16.0.0), which allow flexibility in version updates.
### devDependencies:
Lists the packages required only for development, like testing libraries or build tools.

## package-lock.json
This file locks the versions of the packages and their dependencies installed in your project. It ensures that anyone who installs the project gets the exact same versions of the dependencies

### version pinning:
Unlike package.json, package-lock.json fixes the versions of dependencies. This means if package.json specifies "react": "^16.0.0", package-lock.json might pin it to "react": "16.0.1", ensuring consistent installs across different environments.

### Automatically Generated:
This file is automatically generated and updated when you run npm install. You shouldn't manually edit this file.
